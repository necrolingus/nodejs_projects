javascript: window == main, as in global. in Node, the equivalent of window is global
javascript: document == that is your actual page. document stores your actual page, the dom. In NODE it is called process

RUN THIS FIRST!!
npm init
This creates package.json where it stores all the third party packages you installed with npm

npm install lodash --save
--this will install and update package.json
This will now live in our project in a node modules folder


DO NOT put the nodes_modules folder on github. You should install the stuff when redeploying!
You just run "npm install" with no flags or options. This will cause npm to read package.json
and install the modules listed in package.json


nodemon does what django does. The script always run but when you save changes, it
re-executes
npm install nodemon -g
-g means it wont be added to package.json. It means "global" and is installed as a machine
wide utility (executable)
It gets installed where node and npm live, outside of your project folders!
